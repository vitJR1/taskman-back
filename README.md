# Node-js-template

Node-js-template is a repository that contains a basic template or boilerplate code for building Node.js applications. It is designed to help developers get started quickly and easily with building robust, scalable, and maintainable applications using the Node.js runtime environment.

## Features

The repository includes a set of pre-configured files and folders that can be used as a starting point for any Node.js project. This includes a `package.json` file, which is used to manage project dependencies and scripts, and a basic directory structure for organizing application code and resources.

In addition, the repository includes some common libraries and frameworks that are frequently used in Node.js development, such as Express, Mongoose, and Joi. These can be easily removed or replaced as per the project requirements.

The template also includes a set of unit tests that can be used to test the application code, and a basic configuration file for setting up the development environment.
